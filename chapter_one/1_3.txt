if you have N objects initially, you will have N discrete sets
After every union operation you minus 1 away from N

eg

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 -> 7 sets remaining

0-2

0-2 1 3 4 5 6 -> 6 sets remaining

2-5

0-2-5 1 3 4 6 -> 5 sets remaining

0-4

0-2-4-5 1 3 6 -> 4 sets remaining

3-6

0-2-4-5 1 3-6 -> 3 sets remaining

1-4

0-1-2-4-5 3-6 -> 2 sets remaining

0-6

0-1-2-3-4-5-6 -> 1 set remaining
